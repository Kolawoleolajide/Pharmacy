## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes sales and profitability data for a European pharmacy chain operating across multiple countries, regions, and pharmacies. Using transaction-level sales data, the goal was to uncover how performance varies across geography, products, and promotions, and to provide decision-ready insights for business stakeholders.

The dashboard focuses on **revenue, units sold, margin, and margin percentage**, with drill-down capabilities that allow users to move seamlessly from high-level summaries to detailed pharmacy and product views.

## 🎯 Business Questions Addressed

* How do revenue, units sold, and margin change over time? Are there seasonal patterns?
* Which countries and regions contribute most to total revenue and profitability?
* How does performance vary from country → region → pharmacy?
* Which pharmacies outperform or underperform compared to peers in the same region?
* How do Urban, Suburban, and Rural pharmacies differ in sales and margin?
* Which product categories and brands drive revenue versus profitability?
* Are there high-volume, low-margin or low-volume, high-margin products?
* Do promotions increase revenue without eroding margin?

## 📊 Dashboard Pages

### 1️⃣ Executive Overview

Provides a high-level summary of total revenue, margin, and margin percentage, alongside time-based trends and geographic contribution.

### 2️⃣ Geographic & Pharmacy Performance

Uses hierarchical drill-down (Country → Region → Pharmacy) to analyze regional contribution and benchmark individual pharmacies against peers.

### 3️⃣ Product & Promotion Analysis

Evaluates product categories, brands, and individual products by revenue and margin, and compares promoted versus non-promoted sales to assess promotional effectiveness.

## 🔍 Key Insights

* Revenue and profitability are **geographically concentrated**, creating dependency on a small number of regions.
* Significant performance differences exist between pharmacies within the same region.
* Some products generate high sales volume but relatively low margins, while others contribute disproportionately to profit.
* Promotions often increase volume but can negatively impact margin, depending on product and region.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

* Adopt **targeted promotional strategies** based on product- and region-level profitability.
* Optimize product mix by prioritizing **high-margin categories and brands**.
* Benchmark best-performing pharmacies and replicate successful practices.
* Shift performance tracking from revenue-led to **margin-led KPIs**.
